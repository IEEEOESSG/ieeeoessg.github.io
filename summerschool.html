    <b>Dates</b>: 13-14 Apr 2024.
    </br>
    </br>

<h3>Overview</h3>
IEEE-OES is thrilled to introduce the inaugural edition of the IEEE-OES Summer School. Set to take place in Singapore on April 13-14, 2024, the School offers an exciting lead-up to the <a href="https://singapore24.oceansconference.org/">Singapore OCEANS 2024 conference</a>.
</br>
</br>
  The IEEE-OES Summer School 2024 marks the beginning of an exciting journey for graduate students and early-career professionals. The event offers a unique opportunity to explore a wide range of topics centered around the interdisciplinary field of oceanic engineering and its allied disciplines. The Summer School aims to lay the foundation for future interactions between participating students & faculty, facilitate mentoring and research discussions, and the development of professional relationships within our vast field.
</br>
</br>
  The program for the IEEE-OES Summer School 2024 spans two days and includes presentations by distinguished experts in the field of oceanic engineering, as well as demonstrations and hands-on exercises, and group sessions to encourage cross-disciplinary communication. Additionally, attendees can look forward to engaging in social activities (welcome reception, breakfasts, lunches, and dinner), connect with peers, and establish lasting professional networks.

<h3>Venue</h3>
The IEEE-OES Summer School 2024 will take place at either <a href="hhttps://rsyc.org.sg/">Republic Singapore Yacht club</a>, or <a href="https://www.millenniumhotels.com/en/singapore/grand-copthorne-waterfront/">Grand Copthorne Waterfront Hotel, Singapore</a>.

</br>
</br>
Getting to Singapore: Singapore is one of Southeast Asia's largest aviation hubs, so unless you're coming from Peninsular Malaysia or Batam/Bintan in Indonesia, the easiest way to enter Singapore is by air. In addition to <a href="https://www.singaporeair.com/">Singapore Airlines</a> and <a href="https://www.silkair.com/en_UK/sg/home">SilkAir</a>, Singapore is also home to low-cost carriers, Scoot and Jetstar Asia. In addition to the locals, every carrier of any size in Asia offers flights to Singapore, with Air Asia and Firefly operating dense networks from Singapore.
</br>
</br>
Visa: Many nationalities can enter Singapore without a visa. Refer to the <a href="https://www.ica.gov.sg/visitor/visitor_entryvisa">Immigration and Checkpoints Authority</a> for current guidelines. Entry permit duration depends on nationality and entry point. Most people get 14 or 30 days, although EU, Norwegian, Swiss, and US passport holders can get up to 90 days. If you are a registered team and need invitation letters to apply for a Visa to Singapore, please contact your Team Liaison.
</br>
</br>
Getting around Singapore is easy. The public transportation system is extremely easy to use and taxis are reasonably priced. All public transport systems in Singapore use the <a href="https://www.ezlink.com.sg/">EZ-link contactless RFID farecard</a> or a <a href="https://www.nets.com.sg/personal/transit-payments/nets-flashpay/">Nets Flash Pay card</a>. You can store value on it and use it on trains (MRT) and city buses. The card can be bought at MRT stations can be "topped up" in increments at the farecard vending machines or 7-Eleven stores. Taxis use meters and are reasonably priced and honest. Mobile apps like <a href="https://www.go-jek.com/sg/">Gojek</a>, <a href="https://www.grab.com/sg/taxi/">Grab</a> and <a href="https://tada.global/">TADA</a> are handy in getting Taxis. <a href="https://wikitravel.org/en/Singapore#Get_around">More information here</a>
