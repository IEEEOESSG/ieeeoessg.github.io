            <div><b>Abstract</b>: Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) methods are used for monitoring and studying a wide variety of soniferous marine fauna. The use of automatic recognition techniques has largely underpinned the successes of PAM undertakings by improving the ease and repeatability of analyses. Over the past decade, the adoption of machine learning (ML) based recognition techniques has brought about improved accuracy and reliability in mining large acoustic datasets, facilitating a suite of ecological studies, such as call-or cue-based density estimation, stock identification, or cultural transmissions. This talk will provide an overview of PAM undertakings, present a brief overview of the various automation techniques used and contrast them with modern ML-based techniques. We will present a gentle introduction to ML concepts as they apply to acoustic event recognition, and provide a hands-on demonstration of developing a ML model using real underwater acoustic recordings.</div>

            <div><b>Abstract</b>: Acoustic data provide scientific and engineering insights in fields ranging from biology and communications to ocean and Earth science. This talk provides a survey of the recent advances and transformative potential of machine learning (ML), including deep learning, in the field of acoustics. We first provide an overview of ML theory, then discuss several applications in acoustics, including source localization and geophysical inverse problems. With large volumes of training data, ML can discover models describing complex acoustic phenomena such as human speech and reverberation. ML in acoustics is rapidly developing with compelling results and significant future promise.</div>

  Prior to joining NOAA, Dr. Spinrad held leadership positions at the U.S. Office of Naval Research and Oceanographer of the Navy, where he was awarded the Distinguished Civilian Service Award (highest award given by the U.S. Navy to a civilian). He has held faculty appointments at three universities (OSU, US Naval Academy, and George Mason University), served as Executive Director at the Consortium for Oceanographic Research and Education, was President of Sea Tech, Inc., and worked as a research scientist (at OSU and Bigelow Lab). He also developed the National Ocean Sciences Bowl for high school students. <br><br>
  Dr. Spinrad served as the U.S. permanent representative to the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission from 2005-2009. <br><br>
  He is the recipient of Presidential Rank Awards from Presidents George W. Bush and Barack H. Obama. Dr. Spinrad is past president of The Oceanography Society. He is a Fellow of the American Meteorological Society, MTS, and the Institute of Marine Engineering, Science and Technology (IMarEST), and an IMarEST Chartered Marine Scientist. <br><br>

          <div class="subcontent"><b>Abstract</b>: Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCP) have been used for over past 35 years to measure the relative velocity measurements in rivers and ocean environments. ADCPs transmit high frequency sound underwater in a narrow beam and receive the sound scattered off planktons and other floating objects. The received signal is processed and the Doppler frequency is calculated. There is a multi-disciplinary problem in the transmission and reception of sound underwater due to the involvement of multiple energy conversions and the solution has to include the results of different disciplines such as analog and digital electrical signal processing, electronic communication, electromechanical conversion, vibrational analysis and acoustic radiation. We take into account the different energy conversions occurring in the system to develop and manufacture ADCPs that are widely used for measuring water velocities at different water depths. This presentation will be aimed to introduce the ADCP with its applications and also discuss about the new dual frequency ADCP/DVL.</div>
