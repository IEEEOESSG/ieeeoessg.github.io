          <div class="subcontent"><b>Abstract</b>: The evolution of marine technology is characterized by a balance of “requirements pull” and “capabilities push”.  The most obvious driver for scientific/engineering advancement is the need for enhanced performance, in terms of cost, efficiency and safety.  To this end, the traditional maritime industries and applications (e.g. oil and gas exploration, commercial fishing, marine transport, etc.) have fostered improvements in a range of areas such as dynamic positioning, acoustic sensors, imaging techniques, and data management.  In parallel, seemingly disparate technological communities are providing innovative opportunities for exploitation in marine applications.  Examples include advanced materials, genetic probes, and compressive sensing.  Coupled with developments of a “New Blue Economy”, and the role of technological disruptions, we have an exciting era for defining the trajectory of marine technology.</div>
          <div class="subcontent"><b>Biography</b>: Dr. Richard W. (Rick) Spinrad is a Professor of Oceanography at Oregon State University (OSU), member of the Ocean Studies Board of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine, and President of the Marine Technology Society (MTS).  In 2016 he retired as Chief Scientist of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), where he had been appointed by President Barack Obama in 2014. <br><br>
An internationally recognized scientist and executive with more than 35 years of experience, Dr. Spinrad was the Vice President for Research at OSU, and from 2003 until 2010 was the head of NOAA’s Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research and the National Ocean Service. <br><br>
Among his accomplishments, Dr. Spinrad was a co-lead of the White House Committee that developed the nation’s first set of ocean research priorities and oversaw the revamping of NOAA’s research enterprise. <br><br>
Prior to joining NOAA, Dr. Spinrad held leadership positions at the U.S. Office of Naval Research and Oceanographer of the Navy, where he was awarded the Distinguished Civilian Service Award (highest award given by the U.S. Navy to a civilian). He has held faculty appointments at three universities (OSU, US Naval Academy, and George Mason University), served as Executive Director at the Consortium for Oceanographic Research and Education, was President of Sea Tech, Inc., and worked as a research scientist (at OSU and Bigelow Lab). He also developed the National Ocean Sciences Bowl for high school students. <br><br>
Dr. Spinrad served as the U.S. permanent representative to the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission from 2005-2009. <br><br>
He is the recipient of Presidential Rank Awards from Presidents George W. Bush and Barack H. Obama. Dr. Spinrad is past president of The Oceanography Society. He is a Fellow of the American Meteorological Society, MTS, and the Institute of Marine Engineering, Science and Technology (IMarEST), and an IMarEST Chartered Marine Scientist. <br><br>
Dr. Spinrad received his Bachelor of Arts degree in earth and planetary sciences from The Johns Hopkins University, and his Master of Science and Doctoral degrees in oceanography from Oregon State University.

          <div class="subcontent"><b>Abstract</b>: Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCP) have been used for over past 35 years to measure the relative velocity measurements in rivers and ocean environments. ADCPs transmit high frequency sound underwater in a narrow beam and receive the sound scattered off planktons and other floating objects. The received signal is processed and the Doppler frequency is calculated. There is a multi-disciplinary problem in the transmission and reception of sound underwater due to the involvement of multiple energy conversions and the solution has to include the results of different disciplines such as analog and digital electrical signal processing, electronic communication, electromechanical conversion, vibrational analysis and acoustic radiation. We take into account the different energy conversions occurring in the system to develop and manufacture ADCPs that are widely used for measuring water velocities at different water depths. This presentation will be aimed to introduce the ADCP with its applications and also discuss about the new dual frequency ADCP/DVL.</div>

Dr. Sarangapani`s has 15 years of experience in the fields of electromechanical and electroacoustical acoustic transducers, analytical and numerical modeling of piezoelectric transducers, design of high frequency and low frequency underwater acoustic transducers, sonar signal processing and measurements of currents underwater using ADCP.
