          <h1>Town Hall session at OSM 2022</h1>
    IEEE OES is a technical co-sponsor of Ocean Sciences Meeting 2022, and will be organizing a Town Hall at the event..
    </br>
    </br>
    <b>Event time and date</b>: 25 Feb 2022 (Friday), from 9:00 AM to 10:00 AM U.S. Eastern Standard Time.
    </br>
    </br>

<h3>Connecting Early Career Ocean Professionals with Academia and Industry Experts</h3>

This forum will enable direct interaction between <b>early career ocean professionals (ECOPs)</b> and leading researchers, academics, engineers and industry experts who are solution-providers and manufacturers of sensors and other ocean science equipment. The session will help to understand the needs of the ECOPs in their respective areas of work, and help develop solutions in consultation with the relevant industries by fostering this dialogue. For example, it will look at what accelerated technologies and solutions are required to meet the "UN Decade of Ocean Science" objectives, and how the industry can help to develop suitable solutions for these bearing in mind the needs of ECOPs, thus adhering to the 'co-designed solution-oriented' philosophy of the Decade. Industries may also be able to offer existing solutions on a volunteer basis or offer cost-effective solutions, especially to researchers from economically backward countries, thus accelerating the pace of ocean science in these regions. Leading researchers may be able to point out sources of data they have, or freely available resources that can help the ECOP community.
</br>
</br>
Event format: Talks by each of the panelists (~5 minutes each, total 30 minutes) followed by questions from the audience, polls and discussions.
</br>
</br>
The following <b>themes</b> will be discussed:
<ul>
  <li class="list-group-item">Bridging technology needs - platforms and hardware.</li>
  <li class="list-group-item">Bridging technology needs -  software .</li>
  <li class="list-group-item">Bridging data needs - Data availability, and open data repositories .</li>
  <li class="list-group-item">Data acquisition - ideas and best practices.</li>
</ul>
</br>
The following <b>topics</b> may be discussed: New sensors and technologies, calibration, standards and best practices, software, offshore structural design, safety, capacity building methods etc.
</br>
</br>
<b>Target audience</b>: Early-career Ocean professionals looking for avenues to access and use data or equipment, and looking to connect with leading researchers and solution-providers of sensors and ocean-science equipment who can enable this.
</br>
</br>
<b>Goals</b>: Seed a discussion to bridge between needs of early career professionals, engineers and solution-providers, involving the whole audience. Crystallize specific points on requirements and concerns, and brainstorm ideas to bridge them.

<h4> Panelist biography: </h4>
</br>
</br>
<b>Eric Delory</b> has worked for more than 20 years in research and development of monitoring systems, including signal processing, instrumentation and machine learning, from biomedical applications to environmental monitoring. He joined the Oceanic Platform of the Canary Islands in 2010 as head of the observatory where his main activities have consisted in new systems co-design and end-to-end interoperability. He was the coordinator of NeXOS, a European collaborative project developing compact cost-effective sensors for the monitoring of ocean variables from autonomous platforms, including optical and acoustic sensing. He is involved in the sensors and data technological innovations for several European research infrastructure integration initiatives (EMSO ERIC, JERICO RI, GROOM RI), spanning fixed and mobile ocean observing platforms, to observe the ocean but also develop, test and validate new technologies. He is Associate Editor for the IEEE Oceanic Engineering journal and Frontiers in Marine Science and has recently co-edited the book "Challenges and Innovations in Ocean In-Situ Sensors" (Elsevier, 2018).
</br>
</br>
<b>Richard Patterson</b> is the Director of Sales for Marine Robotics in defense applications at Kongsberg Maritime. He attended California State University Sacramento receiving a BS Electrical & Electronic Engineering. He then spent 8 years in the US Navy as a nuclear engineer and officer in the submarine service. He worked for a period of time in the semiconductor industry and then found my way back into marine technology. He has worked for Kongsberg Maritime over the last 13 years in various capacities including Sales Engineer for all Sensors and Robotics products, General Manager of Kongsberg’s Seaglider program, and Sr. Sales Manager for Marine Robotics.
</br>
</br>
<b>Evgeniia Kostianaia </b> is the Global Coordinator of the UN Ocean Decade endorsed Programme for Early Career Ocean Professionals ("ECOP Programme") and Consultant at the IOC-UNESCO. She is a marine environmental manager with the research interests in ocean sustainability, marine pollution, ocean clusters, and climate change and food security. In the framework of her research projects at the P.P. Shirshov Institute of Oceanology and Geophysical Center (Moscow, Russia), Evgeniia explores impacts of climate change on railway infrastructure, coastal tourism and is involved in the DOORS Project (“Developing Optimal and Open Research Support for the Black Sea”).
</br>
Evgeniia also acts as the Moscow Focal Point of the International Ocean Institute (Malta) and a Black Sea Young Ambassador within the Black Sea Connect Project. She is a member of a working group on sustainable development of the Caspian Sea region and the Caspian Integrated Scientific Network (CASPISNET). She has recently co-edited the book in two volumes “Plastics in the Aquatic Environment” (Springer, 2022).
