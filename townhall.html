          <h1>Upcoming Town Hall session organized at OSM 2022</h1>
    IEEE OES is a technical co-sponsor of Ocean Sciences Meeting 2022, and will be organizing a Town Hall at the event. Details about the event can be found here (more will be updated in the days to come).
    </br>
    </br>
    <b>Event time and date</b>: 25 Feb 2022 (Friday), from 9:00 AM to 10:00 AM U.S. Eastern Standard Time.
    </br>
    </br>

<h3>Connecting Early Career Ocean Professionals with Academia and Industry Experts</h3>

This forum will enable direct interaction between <b>early career ocean professionals (ECOPs)</b> and leading researchers, academics, engineers and industry experts who are solution-providers and manufacturers of sensors and other ocean science equipment. The session will help to understand the needs of the ECOPs in their respective areas of work, and help develop solutions in consultation with the relevant industries by fostering this dialogue. For example, it will look at what accelerated technologies and solutions are required to meet the "UN Decade of Ocean Science" objectives, and how the industry can help to develop suitable solutions for these bearing in mind the needs of ECOPs, thus adhering to the 'co-designed solution-oriented' philosophy of the Decade. Industries may also be able to offer existing solutions on a volunteer basis or offer cost-effective solutions, especially to researchers from economically backward countries, thus accelerating the pace of ocean science in these regions. Leading researchers may be able to point out sources of data they have, or freely available resources that can help the ECOP community.
</br>
</br>
Event format: Talks by each of the panelists (~5 minutes each, total 30 minutes) followed by questions from the audience, polls and discussions.
</br>
</br>
The following <b>themes</b> will be discussed:
<ul>
  <li class="list-group-item">Bridging technology needs - platforms and hardware.</li>
  <li class="list-group-item">Bridging technology needs -  software .</li>
  <li class="list-group-item">Bridging data needs - Data availability, and open data repositories .</li>
  <li class="list-group-item">Data acquisition - ideas and best practices.</li>
</ul>
</br>
The following <b>topics</b> may be discussed: New sensors and technologies, calibration, standards and best practices, software, offshore structural design, safety, capacity building methods etc.
</br>
</br>
<b>Target audience</b>: Early-career Ocean professionals looking for avenues to access and use data or equipment, and looking to connect with leading researchers and solution-providers of sensors and ocean-science equipment who can enable this.
</br>
</br>
<b>Goals</b>: Seed a discussion to bridge between needs of early career professionals, engineers and solution-providers, involving the whole audience. Crystallize specific points on requirements and concerns, and brainstorm ideas to bridge them.

<b> Panelist biography: </b>
</br>
</br>
Eric Delory: Eric Delory has worked for more than 20 years in research and development of monitoring systems, including signal processing, instrumentation and machine learning, from biomedical applications to environmental monitoring. He joined the Oceanic Platform of the Canary Islands in 2010 as head of the observatory where his main activities have consisted in new systems co-design and end-to-end interoperability. He was the coordinator of NeXOS, a European collaborative project developing compact cost-effective sensors for the monitoring of ocean variables from autonomous platforms, including optical and acoustic sensing. He is involved in the sensors and data technological innovations for several European research infrastructure integration initiatives (EMSO ERIC, JERICO RI, GROOM RI), spanning fixed and mobile ocean observing platforms, to observe the ocean but also develop, test and validate new technologies. He is Associate Editor for the IEEE Oceanic Engineering journal and Frontiers in Marine Science and has recently co-edited the book "Challenges and Innovations in Ocean In-Situ Sensors" (Elsevier, 2018).
